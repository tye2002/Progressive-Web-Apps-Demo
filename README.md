## Introduction
A Progressive Web App is a web app that delivers an app-like experience to users by using modern web capabilities.

## PWA Principles
* **Web App Manifest** is a simple JSON file that informs the browser about your web app.

* **Service Workers** is a script that your browser runs in the background in a separate thread. Service Worker caching of the app shell, allowing it to load without the network

* **Add to Home Screen Banner** is a feature available in modern browsers that allows a user to "install" a web app.

* **Push Notification** let your Progressive Web App go far beyond the browser and are an incredibly useful way to (re)engage with website visitors.

**In order for the app install prompts to display, your app must:**
* App Install banner samples are available
* A valid Web App Manifest 
* Served over HTTPS 
* A valid service worker registered
